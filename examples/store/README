This is a Grails application that demonstrates: 
1. HTML marked up with WIFL RDFa annotations.
2. The WIFL console and validator software.
3. The automatic generation of HTML+WIFL from WADL.

The application uses the grails-wifl-plugin for the WIFL console, validator,
and transformation software.

The WIFL RDFa annotations are found in grails-app/views/index.gsp.

The console and validator software is included in grails-app/views/index.gsp
by these elements within <head>:
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="wifl/css/wifl-console.css"></link>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="wifl/css/jquery-ui.css"></link>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="wifl/js/require-jquery.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    require.config({ baseUrl: "wifl/js" });
    require(["wifl-console"]);
  </script>

The application may be run without an installation of Grails from the 
command-line with the Grails wrapper (grailsw or grailsw.bat)
$ ./grailsw -Dwifl.repository.url=file:///../../settings/repository run-app
(proxy properties may be required).
This assumes that the other WIFL Ivy artifacts have been built and are
available at the URL specified by 'wifl.repository.url'
