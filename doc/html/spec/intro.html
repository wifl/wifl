<p>The Web InterFace Language (WIFL) addresses the description of a web 
application with RESTful APIs. 
Its goal is to cover common idioms of RESTful APIs and is intended to be 
used in the annotation of HTML with RDFa. 
This document contains a detailed description of the model,
including the object and datatype classes.
The description is marked up with 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa</a>
using the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF schema vocabulary</a>.</p>

<p>For an example, see the <a href="../store.html">store application</a>,
which contains a description of its RESTful API using WIFL.</p>

<p>For a comparison of WIFL and WADL, see 
<a href="../wadl-diffs.html">WIFL is not WADL</a>.</p>
